* Write JS like HTML

JSX -> JavScript XML

Flavor of JavaScript that looks like HTML -> making it declarative not imperative.

React just creates JS objects.


Declarative vs. Imperative Programming:

### Why React?

### What is JSX?

### Writing Custom Components

### Styling In React

What is the difference between this and .append()?

JSON.stringify -> the object


## What is a React Component?

A function that returns React elements. React elements are JS objects.


#### Composable Code

Lego bricks -> Statue of David

#### Declarative

What should be done?

"Just tell me what to do, and I will worry about how to do it."

Step by step.


#### Imperative

How should it be done?

"Describe it to me step by step, how it should be done. Then, I will do it."

### Q & A

1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` when reacting?

    The JSX syntax is defined in React :)

2. What is wrong w/ this code:

```
const page = (
   <h1>hi Rye.</h1>
   <p>This is not the right way.</p>
)   
```

3. What does it mean for something to be declarative over imperative?
4. What does it mean for something to be composable?

What are fragment tags?
