 1. Write a function that takes a string and a single character as arguments and
    returns the number of times that character occurs in the string.

 2. Write a function that takes two arrays as arguments and returns a new array
    containing their union (no duplicates, all elements from both).

// Strings:

// Write a JavaScript function to check whether an input is a string or not.

// Write a JavaScript function to split a string and convert it into an array of words. For example, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" should be converted to ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"].

// Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example, "Hello World" would become "hELLO wORLD".

// Write a JavaScript function to find the longest word within a string.

// Write a JavaScript function to reverse a string.

// Write a JavaScript function to check if a string contains a certain word.

// Write a function to count the occurrences of a substring in a string.

// Arrays:

// Write a JavaScript function to check whether an input is an array or not.

// Write a JavaScript function to get the first 'n' elements of an array.

// Write a JavaScript function to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.

// Write a JavaScript function to find the most frequent item of an array.

// Write a JavaScript function to remove a specific element from an array.

// Write a JavaScript function to add an item at the end of an array.

// Write a JavaScript function to find duplicates in an array.

// Write a function to flatten an array. For example, [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]] should become [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

// Write a function that will return the sum of all elements in an array.


### Algorithms

#### Sorting Algorithms

 1. What is a sorting algorithm? Why is it important in programming?
 2. Can you describe how the bubble sort algorithm works? What is it's time
    complexity in the worst-case scenario?
 3. What are the key differences between bubble sort, selection sort, and 
    insertion sort?
 4. Walk through the steps of the merge sort algorithm?
    Explain the concept of partitioning in Quick sort. How does it affect the overall sorting process?
    // Write a code snippet to implement Insertion sort.

// Advanced Sorting Algorithms

// Can you describe the process of Heap sort? How does it differ from Selection sort?
// Explain Bucket sort. In what scenarios is it particularly useful?
// Can you elaborate on the working of Radix sort? How is it different from other comparison-based sorting algorithms?
// How does Counting sort work? What are its limitations?
// Write a code snippet to implement Heap sort.

// Introduction to Searching Algorithms

// What is a searching algorithm? Why is it crucial in programming?
// Can you walk me through how Linear search works?
// How does Binary Search work? When should it be used over Linear Search?
// What is a Hashmap? How does it improve search efficiency?
// Write a code snippet to implement Binary Search.

// Advanced Searching Algorithms

// Explain the working of Ternary search. How does it compare with Binary search?
// What is Jump search? Under what circumstances would you use it?
// Can you describe how Exponential search works?
// How do you choose which searching algorithm to use in a given situation?
// Write a code snippet to implement Jump search.
