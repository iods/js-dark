Things I find interesting about this language and how to write it.


Containerization of Applications
--------------------------------

We often times talk about the containerization of our backend applications; however, not
the frontend. It is actually fairly easy to. 

Docker allows us to containerize an application and run it anywhere.


docker ps -a is when you cant see it.



Lexical Structure
-----------------

As it is in other languages, the lexical structure is a set of elementary rules that
specify how to write programs with that language. It is the lowest-level syntax of
a language defining what variable names look like, the delimiter characters for
comments, and what separates one program statement from the next.
* Case Sensitivity
* Commenting
* Literals
* Identifiers and Reserved Words
* Unicode
* Optional Semi-Colons
