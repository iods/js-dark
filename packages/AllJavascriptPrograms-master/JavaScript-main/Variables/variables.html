    <!-- 
        Variable :- variable is a container that stores a value
        - There are three type of variables present in javascript 
            1] var
            2] let 
            3] const

        difference between let, var and const
        - var is globally scoped variable, while let and const are block scoped variables
        - var can be updated and re-declare within its scope, let can be updated but cannot be re-declared and const neither be updated nor be re-declared 
        - var variables are initialized with undefined whereas let and const variables cannot initialized
        - const must be initialized during declaration unlike let and var
        - var supports hoisting concept, while let and const does not support hoisting concept
