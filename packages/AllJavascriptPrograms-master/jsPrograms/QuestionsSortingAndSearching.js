// *For Interviews

// Can you tell me about a time when you had to select a specific sorting or searching algorithm over another for a project? Why did you choose that one, and what was the result?
// In your experience, which sorting or searching algorithms have you found to be most effective in real-world applications?
// What are some of the challenges you've faced when implementing these algorithms, and how did you overcome them?
// If you had to teach a novice programmer about sorting and searching algorithms, how would you approach it?
